# WPFLandmarkAI
A WPF application capable of identifying landmarks using Microsoft's Custom Vision AI (www.customvision.ai).

The app has a trained model that is capable of identifying images of the Eiffel Tower, the Golden Gate bride, and the Temple of Kukulc√°n.
When an image of one of the aforementioned locations is uploaded, a call to the Custom Vision API is made and the probability of each possible classification is displayed.
This is not a perfect classifier as can be seen from the example of the Moon and the mountains shown in the gif below.
